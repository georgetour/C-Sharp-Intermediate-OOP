1. Class Coupling
By Class Coupling we meen how classes are connected each other and their subsystems. In an application they are packaged in namespaces and assemblies.

Example

Class K 

Class A
Class B has relation with Class A

Class C has relation with Class B

Class D and E have relation with Class C

So if we make a change to Class A it will affect Class B and Class C which are depended in it but also D and E.

2. Tightly Coupling
In the above example we have tighly coupling which means classes are tightly related and depend each other a lot.
This happens when a class has many responsibilities and tries to pass them in other classes.

3. Loosely Coupling
Losely coupling has many advanctages over tightly coupling but the major difference is that when you change something in top class doesn't break all
classes realted to it. The change is isolated and doesn;t affect other parts of the application.

How you achieve that?

- Encapsulation
- Relationships between classes
- Interfaces

4. Relationships
- Inheritance
- Composition(result in less coupling)
