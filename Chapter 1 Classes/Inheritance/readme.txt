1. What is Inheritance
Inheritance is one of the pillars of OOP and it's when a class inherits code from the other. 
Imagine it like a parent with a child aht the child might inherited the blue eyes of the father.

- Benefits
Code reusability and Polymorphic behaviour

Example of Inheritance

2. UML 
Unified Model Language allows to represent in simple graphic design a software application.

3. Syntax

- Example

public class PresentationObject
{

 //Common shared code

}

public class Text:PresentationObject
{

  //Code specific to Text

}

Don't forget that the object class is the parent of all classes and you will always have predefined methods when you create 
a new object like Equals, GetHashCode, GetType, ToString
